## Post-filters

Post-filtering of query results can be performed at any step by using [`filter` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#filter-pipe).

It is also possible to perform post-filtering of the [selected log entries](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#filters) at client side with `grep` and similar Unix commands
according to [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#command-line).
