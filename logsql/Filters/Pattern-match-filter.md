### Pattern match filter

VictoriaLogs supports filtering logs by patterns with the `pattern_match("pattern")` filter. This filter matches logs where
[`_msg` field](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#message-field) contains the given `"pattern"`.

The filter can be applied to any given log field with the `log_field:pattern_match("pattern")` syntax.

The `"pattern"` must contain the text to match, plus arbitrary number of the following placeholders:

- `<N>` - matches any integer number. It also matches hexadecimal numbers with the length of 4 chars and longer. For example, it matches `123` and `12abcdEF`.
  It doesn't match floating point numbers such as `123.456`. Use `<N>.<N>` pattern for matching such numbers.
- `<UUID>` - matches any UUID such as `2edfed59-3e98-4073-bbb2-28d321ca71a7`.
- `<IP4>` - matches IPv4 such as `123.45.67.89`. Use `<IP4>/<N>` for matching IPv4 masks.
- `<TIME>` - matches time strings such as `10:20:30`. It also captures fractional seconds such as `10:20:30.123` and `10:20:30,123`.
- `<DATE>` - matches date strings such as `2025-10-20` and `2025/10/20`.
- `<DATETIME>` - matches datetime strings such as `2025-10-20T08:09:11` and `2025-10-20 08:09:11`. It also captures fractional seconds and timezones.
- `<W>` - matches any [word](#word) or any quoted string in single quotes, double quotes and backticks.

Such patterns are generated by the [`collapse_nums` pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#collapse_nums-pipe).

For example, the following filter matches `_msg` field with the `<arbitrary_prefix>user_id=123, ip=45.67.89.12, time=2025-10-20T23:32:12Z<arbitrary_suffix>` contents:

```logsql
pattern_match("user_id=<N>, ip=<IP4>, time=<DATETIME>")
```

If you need to match the whole `_msg` field value, then use the `pattern_match_full("pattern")` filter.
